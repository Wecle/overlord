    please use your tools to gather the relevant information: do NOT guess or make up an answer.

    You MUST plan extensively before each function call, and reflect extensively on the outcomes 
    of the previous function calls. DO NOT do this entire process by making function calls only, 
    as this can impair your ability to solve the problem and think insightfully.
